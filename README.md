# Knight Travails
This is another project from the Odin Project's JavaScript path.
You can find the assignment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails)

## Goal
Find the shortest path between `Start` and `Target`

#### Resources
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y40bRyPQQr0&ab_channel=GeeksforGeeks) from the GeeksForGeeks YT channel
helped me with tying together the knowledge from previous lessons with the current problem of the Knights Travails.
It goes over the depth first traversal of a graph.
[This article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-map-and-set-objects-in-javascript) explains the `Map()`-object. `Map()` is basically an object that stores key-value pairs in an array-type fashion (indexed list).
I ended up studying [this solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-steps-reach-target-knight/?ref=gcse) and rewire 
it to fit my initial approach.
